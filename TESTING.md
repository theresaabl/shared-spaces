## Code Validation


### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. Everything worked as expected, there are only slight differences in the appearance of font weight and look of the logo in Firefox.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop. For a future release it would make sense to improve the performance score by optimizing the image sizes, for this release the performance score is fast enough. The most important pages where the data is manipulated do have a good score.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. I wrote tests to test the forms and the views of all apps, I tested for page loading statuses, redirects, form validation, form posting, content, context etc. In total I wrote 135 tests to test the functionality of my project. In a real world project, there would be even more extensive tests one could think of and perform.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal:

- `python3 manage.py test`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit=*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,manage.py manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the report, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

I have used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/TheresaAbl/shared-spaces/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/theresaabl/shared-spaces/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

Examples:

### Unfixed Bugs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
