## Code Validation


### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. Everything worked as expected, there are only slight differences in the appearance of font weight and look of the logo in Firefox.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop. For a future release it would make sense to improve the performance score by optimizing the image sizes, for this release the performance score is fast enough. The most important pages where the data is manipulated do have a good score.

## Defensive Programming

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important! When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each form field. Examples of this could include (but not limited to):

All Projects:

- Users cannot submit an empty form (add the `required` attribute)
- Users must enter valid field types (ensure the correct input `type=""` is used)
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted pages

Python Projects:

- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality if not authenticated (if login functionality exists)
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers/admins

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form, or CRUD functionality, for data manipulation on a database. Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser). You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable (can someone else replicate the same outcome?). Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website. Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine, consider documenting tests on each element of the page (eg. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their "happy flow", their "bad/exception flow", mentioning the expected and observed results, and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

- Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing. Note that the majority of the functionality was also covered in the automated tests below (see #automated-testing). Screenshots for the respective features and messages are all available in the [features](README.md/#existing-features) section of the [README.md](README.md)

| Footer | The footer displays the copyright and the sharedspaces logo link to my GitHub page. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/footer.png) |
| Resident Space | Authenticated visitors can can access a personal resident dashboard. Where they can see event spaces, their own event space bookings and resident requests. They can also make new bookings and requests and edit and delete them. The bookings are sorted into pending, approved, denied and past bookings and the maintenance requests and messages are sorted into open, in progress and closed requests. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/dashboard.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/dashboard-bookings-requests-lenovo.png) |

| Event Space Booking | The event space booking form allows registered users to book event spaces. The form is validated and ensures that there are no bookings at the same time in the same space, that there is at least one hour between bookings and that each booking has a duration of at least one hour where the end time is after the start time. Specific error messages are displayed, as well as a success message in case the booking was successful. The booking then needs to be approve by the admin and is now pending, this is stated in the success message. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/book-event-space-form.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/successful-booking-message.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/booking-error-duplicate.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/booking-error-end-time.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/booking-error-short-duration.png) |

| Edit Event Space Booking | Each booking of a user displayed in their resident space has an edit button which leads to a prefilled edit event space form. This form is again validated like when originally booked. The status is set to pending again unless only the occasion and the notes are changed. A success message is displayed. The title and the submit button change to edit and update (this is the same in all edit forms throughout the site). There is a message in case no changes were made.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. I wrote tests to test the forms and the views of all apps, I tested for page loading statuses, redirects, form validation, form posting, content, context etc. In total I wrote 135 tests to test the functionality of my project. In a real world project, there would be even more extensive tests one could think of and perform.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal:

- `python3 manage.py test`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit=*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,manage.py manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the report, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:
