## Code Validation


### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. Everything worked as expected, there are only slight differences in the appearance of font weight and look of the logo in Firefox.

## Lighthouse Audit

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports. Avoid testing the local version (Gitpod/VSCode/etc.), as this can have knock-on effects for performance. If you don't have "Lighthouse" in your Developer Tools, it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Unless your project is a single-page application (SPA), you should test Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages, for both *mobile* and *desktop*.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop. For a future release it would make sense to improve the performance score by optimizing the image sizes, for this release the performance score is fast enough and more importantly the most important pages where data is manipulated do have a good score.

## Defensive Programming

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important! When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each form field. Examples of this could include (but not limited to):

All Projects:

- Users cannot submit an empty form (add the `required` attribute)
- Users must enter valid field types (ensure the correct input `type=""` is used)
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted pages

Python Projects:

- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality if not authenticated (if login functionality exists)
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers/admins

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form, or CRUD functionality, for data manipulation on a database. Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser). You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable (can someone else replicate the same outcome?). Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website. Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine, consider documenting tests on each element of the page (eg. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their "happy flow", their "bad/exception flow", mentioning the expected and observed results, and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

- Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| | Feature is expected to block standard users from brute-forcing admin pages. | Attempted to navigate to admin-only pages by manipulating the URL (e.g., `/admin`). | Access was blocked, and a message was displayed showing denied access. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/brute-force.png) |
| 404 Error Page | Feature is expected to display a 404 error page for non-existent pages. | Navigated to an invalid URL (e.g., `/test`). | A custom 404 error page was displayed as expected. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/404.png) |

## User Story Testing

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Testing User Stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **Features** should already align with the **User Stories**, so this should be as simple as creating a table with the User Story, matching with the re-used screenshot from the respective Feature.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. I wrote tests to test the forms and the views of all apps, I tested for page loading statuses, redirects, form validation, form posting, content, context etc. In total I wrote 135 tests to test the functionality of my project. In a real world project, there would be even more extensive tests one could think of and perform.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal:

- `python3 manage.py test`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit=*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,manage.py manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the report, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:
